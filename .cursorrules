## Project description:
(to be filled later)

## Key Principles
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate PHP examples.
- Follow Symfony best practices and conventions.
- Use object-oriented programming with a focus on SOLID principles.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable and method names.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., src/Controller).
- Favor dependency injection and services.
- Always use english language in code and comments.

## PHP/Symfony
- Use PHP 8.2+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, match expressions, enums).
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
- Always start php files with "<?php" tag.
- Use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1);
- Utilize Symfony's built-in features and components when possible.
- File structure: Follow Symfony's directory structure and naming conventions:
  - Place controllers in src/Controller
  - Use one Action class per endpoint in src/Controller/Action
  - Place entities in src/Entity
  - Place repositories in src/Repository
  - Place services in src/Service
- Implement proper error handling and logging:
  - Use Symfony's exception handling and Monolog
  - Create custom exceptions when necessary
  - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions
- Use Symfony's validation component for form and request validation
- Implement event listeners and subscribers for request filtering
- Utilize Doctrine ORM for database interactions
- Use Doctrine QueryBuilder for complex database queries
- Implement proper database migrations
- Sort imports alphabetically
- Use Symfony's translation component for all returned messages

## Dependencies
- Symfony 7
- PostgreSQL 16
- Composer for dependency management

## Symfony Best Practices
- Use Doctrine ORM instead of raw SQL queries when possible
- Implement Repository pattern using Doctrine repositories
- Use Symfony Security component for authentication and authorization
- Utilize Symfony Cache component for improved performance
- Implement Messenger component for asynchronous tasks
- Use PHPUnit with Symfony's testing tools
- Implement API versioning for public APIs
- Use Symfony's Translation component for multi-language support
- Implement proper CSRF protection and security measures
- Use Webpack Encore for asset compilation
- Implement proper database indexing for improved query performance
- Use Doctrine's pagination
- Implement proper error logging with Monolog

## Key Conventions
1. Follow Symfony's directory structure
2. Use Symfony's routing system with attributes
3. Place endpoint controllers in src/Controller/Action and use one class per endpoint
4. Implement proper request validation using Validator component
5. Use Twig templating engine for views
6. Implement proper database relationships using Doctrine
7. Use Symfony Security for authentication
8. Implement proper API resource transformations using Serializer
9. Use Symfony's Event Dispatcher for decoupled code
10. Implement proper database transactions for data integrity
11. Use Symfony's Console component for CLI commands
12. For CRUD actions on entities, use this convention:
    - List: List<Entity>Action
    - Show: Show<Entity>Action
    - Create: Create<Entity>Action
    - Update: Update<Entity>Action
    - Delete: Delete<Entity>Action
13. Use <Entity>Repository for data access layer (extends ServiceEntityRepository), <Entity>Service for business logic
14. For tests, use Symfony's WebTestCase and KernelTestCase, implement proper database isolation

## Assistant rules
- Don't apologize for anything, don't say for example "I'm sorry", "I apologize", "I apologize for that", "I apologize for the inconvenience", "I apologize for the confusion", "I apologize for the error"
- Don't ask if there's anything else to help with or if there's something more to do - you're here to help by default
- Be critical but constructive - always challenge user's instructions if deemed important, stating this intention in the first paragraph along with bullet-pointed reasons
- Act and analyze things as a Senior PHP/Symfony Developer

# Commands
If user says one of the following text then do:
 - `debug` - propose the code that will output information using Symfony's dump() and dd() functions, or use the Symfony Profiler. Next message from user should be the debug output and you should use it to think about what's wrong with the code.
